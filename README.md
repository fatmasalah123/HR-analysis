# HR Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project involves the analysis of HR datasets to gain insights into employee performance, attrition, and other key HR metrics. The analysis aims to provide actionable insights to improve HR strategies and workforce management.

## Dataset Description
### Training Dataset (train.csv)
The training dataset contains information about employees, including various attributes related to their performance and demographic details. Key features include:

- Employee ID: A unique identifier for each employee.
- Age: The age of the employee.
- Gender: The gender of the employee.
- Department: The department where the employee works.
- Job Role: The role or position of the employee.
- Years at Company: The number of years the employee has been with the company.
- Performance Rating: The performance rating of the employee.
- Attrition: Indicates whether the employee has left the company (1) or not (0)

### Test Dataset (test.csv)
The test dataset contains similar information as the training dataset but is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

## Analysis Goals
1- Attrition Analysis: Identify factors contributing to employee attrition.
2- Performance Evaluation: Analyze employee performance ratings across different departments and job roles.
3- Demographic Insights: Explore demographic trends and their impact on HR metrics.
4- Predictive Modeling: Build predictive models to forecast employee attrition and performance ratings.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python: The primary programming language used.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Scikit-learn: For building predictive models.
- Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
- Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data analysis.
